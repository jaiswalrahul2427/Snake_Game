# Snake_Game

Welcome to my Snake game project in Java! 🐍 This classic game is implemented using Java Swing for the graphical interface. It features a dynamic snake that grows longer as it eats food, while avoiding collisions with itself and the boundaries of the game board. The game offers an immersive experience with smooth movement and vibrant graphics. Dive into the world of retro gaming and challenge yourself to achieve the highest score! Feel free to explore the code and contribute to its development. Happy coding!🎮
